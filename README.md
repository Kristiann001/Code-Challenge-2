// Title 
Code Challenge Week Two Phase One.

// Description 
Its the use of comments on code and working on solving code problems.

//Project SetUp
1. Create a repository on your GitHub account.

2. Use Javascript to wire down the solution.
NB: Use one folder, with 3 files for each solution. Please note that a single file should only hold one solution.

a. Write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

b. Write a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7] and -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

c. You are tasked with writing a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. How would you implement this function efficiently, ensuring that it accurately identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array? For example if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] it should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].

3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.
